        <p> This website is interesting with is unique design. Imagery changes when you scroll down
        to the appropriate timeline they are trying to show. </p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://treehugger.com"><img src="treehugger.png"></a>
        </br>
        <p> This is my favorite website to look for new environmental news and ideas for some design.
        They recently changed their web page design. It <br>is more refined now; Content is following the grid
        structure and everything is in order. However their info is still always great.</p> 
        <br>
        <a href="http://hereistoday.com"><img src="HEREISTODAY.png"></a>
        </br>
        <p> This website caught my eye by being simplistic and informative. When you click the image in the middle it changes every time giving
        new <br>information about the earth. 
        <br>
        <a href="http://lixpen.com"><img src="lixpen.png"></a>
        </br>
        <p> It was crazy when news announced first 3D pen coming out. Their website is as interesting as the product itself.
        When you scroll down the <br>pages, pen follows you and changes into different situations. I think it is a nice and clever
        way to promote your product.</p>

        <a href="http://adamamaral.com"><img src="ADAM.png"></a>
        </br>
        <p> This is a portfolio website of Adam Amaral. I first was his work in the music video of "Little People" and I immediately
        wanted to check<br> his other work. His website is full of his personality and I like how colorful it is, just like his work.</p> 
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.razvangarofeanu.com/#the-g"><img src="GARPHEE.png"></a>
        </br>
        <p> The portfolio website of this designer starts with a little fictional character called Garphee. I like how Garphee is used 
        for introduction on<br> the welcome page. It caches my eyes as something moving on the screen and sending small messages towards the user to
        make a small<br> introduction before you move to other pages.

        <a href="http://uxplore.francescobalducci.com/"><img src="uxplore.png"></a>
        </br>
        <p> This is a website that I have set up on my tumbler page. It's a nice website to look up for new app and web designs.</p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://kenjiendo.com/"><img src="kenjiendo.png"></a>
        </br>
        <p> This artist has the most great website I've seen so far. It is fun to scroll down the pages and just navigate 
        throughout the whole website.<br> You never know when some random elements will pop up and the overall feeling of website
         is somewhat architectural. </p>
        <br>
        <a href="http://hellonod.com/"><img src="hellonod.png"></a>
        </br>
        <p> This website is great by it's interactive quality. It shows how product works in different settings.
        You also can click on the hand image and<br> it does other things too.</p>
        <br>

        <p>
        An educational website for kids by MOMA give a nice insight to the history of design and how it evolved. I think it's a nice way to make <br>a viewer engage
        with the website.

        <p>This website caught my eye with their funny and disturbing animation that is changing with every scroll down.

        <p> This website gives a good sense of what company does and shows their esthetics well. It shows a good attention to details.
